| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We provide interactive online visualization of seminal cancer genomics datasets, including data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and UCSC RNA-seq compendium. 

Xena supports virtually any functional genomics data, including SNVs, INDELs, large structural variants, copy number variation, gene-, transcript-, exon-, miRNA-, LncRNA-, protein-expressions, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq signals, phenotypic annotations, and higher-level derived genomic parameters.

## TCGA
TCGA is our most used data resource. We host serveral versions of the TCGA data.
- [TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas](https://pancanatlas.xenahubs.net) As its concluding project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network completes the most comprehensive cross-cancer analysis to date: The Pan-Cancer Atlas. Xena displays the curated genomics and clinical data generated by the Pan-Cancer Atlas consortium working groups.

- [TCGA data from Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.xenahubs.net) TCGA data uniformaly re-analyzed at GDC using the latest Human Genome Assembly hg38. We download all open-access tier data from GDC, compile individual files into datasets organized by cohorts (33 individual tumor cohorts as well as a Pancan cohort. Xena displays the compiled datasets.

- [TCGA data in the UCSC RNA-seq Recompute Compendium](https://toil.xenahubs.net) TCGA data has been co-analyzed with GTEx data using the UCSC bioinformatic pipeline (TOIL RNA-seq) and can be used to compare tumor vs normal gene and transcript expression from the matching tissue of origin. Xena hosts gene and transcript expression results of the UCSC RNA-seq recompute compendium.

- [Legacy TCGA data](https://tcga.xenahubs.net) Data generated and published by TCGA Research Network before the Pan-Cancer Atlas publications. Xena displays the level-3 data.

## More studies
- [UCSC RNA-seq recompute compendium](https://toil.xenahubs.net) TCGA, TARGET and GTEx RNA-seq data are uniformly re-aligned to hg38 genome, and re-processed using RSEM and Kallisto methods with gencode v23 annotations to generate expression estimates for ~60,000 genes and ~200,000 transcripts, including many LncRNAs. Xena hosts and displays gene and transcript expression results of this analysis.

- [ICGC](https://icgc.xenahubs.net) International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) goal is to obtain a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in 50 different tumor types and/or subtypes which are of clinical and societal importance across the globe. It includes TCGA data (U.S.A.) plus data contributed by groups from other countries in the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The resource has publically-accessible non-coding somatic mutation data from non-TCGA samples.

- [MET500](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=MET500%20(expression%20centric)) Xena displays gene expression data from the metastatic cancer study published in [Robinson et al 2017 Integrative clinical genomics of metastatic cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783718)

- [CCLE](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=Cancer%20Cell%20Line%20Encyclopedia%20(CCLE)) Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel (~1100) of human cancer cell lines.
