| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We have data from [TCGA pancan atlas](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://tcga.xenahubs.net:443), [ICGC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://icgc.xenahubs.net:443), [GDC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://gdc.xenahubs.net:443), legacy TCGA data (pre-GDC), CCLE, [TARGET](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https://toil.xenahubs.net), and more.

##TCGA
TCGA is our most used dataset with it's rich genomic data (mutation, expression, copy number data, methylation, protein, atac-seq) on 40+ cancer types. TCGA has multiple survival endpoints for Kaplan Meier analysis and some other basic phenotype and clinical data.

We host many versions of the TCGA data, including:
- the newest data that was generated by the [PanCan Atlas](https://xena.ucsc.edu/tag/help/)
- TCGA data hosted by the GDC  <link>
- TCGA data that has been co-analyzed with GTEx normal tissue samples and can be used to compare tumor vs normal expression <link>
- legacy TCGA data that was generated for each of the original TCGA papers <link>

##More studies
- ICGC: Includes TCGA data plus more from an international group. Has non-coding mutations for non-TCGA samples <link>
- MET500: Metastatic Breast Cancer Study <link>
- CCLE <link>
- NCI60 <link>
