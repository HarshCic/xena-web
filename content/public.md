| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We have data from TCGA pancan atlas, ICGC, GDC, legacy TCGA data (pre-GDC), CCLE, TARGET, and more.

##TCGA
TCGA is our most used dataset with it's rich genomic data (mutation, expression, copy number data, methylation, protein, ATAC-seq) on 40+ cancer types. TCGA has multiple survival endpoints for Kaplan Meier analysis and some other basic phenotype and clinical data.

We host many versions of the TCGA data, including:
- [The newest data that was generated by the PanCan Atlas](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN))
- [TCGA data hosted by the GDC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https%3A%2F%2Fgdc.xenahubs.net)
- [TCGA data that has been co-analyzed with GTEx normal tissue samples and can be used to compare tumor vs normal expression](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20TARGET%20GTEx)
- [legacy TCGA data that was generated for each of the original TCGA papers](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://tcga.xenahubs.net:443)

##More studies
- [ICGC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://icgc.xenahubs.net:443): Includes TCGA data plus more from an international group. Has non-coding mutations for non-TCGA samples
- [MET500](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=MET500%20(expression%20centric)): Metastatic Breast Cancer Study. [Robinson et al 2017 Integrative clinical genomics of metastatic cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783718)
- [CCLE](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=Cancer%20Cell%20Line%20Encyclopedia%20(CCLE)): Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer models
