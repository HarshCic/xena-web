| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We have data from TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, ICGC, GDC, legacy TCGA data, UCSC RNA-seq recompute compendium, and more.

##TCGA
TCGA is our most used dataset with it's rich genomic data (somatic mutation, gene-, exon-, miRNA-expression, copy number variation, DNA methylation, RPPA protein and phospho protein expression, ATAC-seq) on 40 cancer types. TCGA has multiple survival endpoints for Kaplan Meier analysis as well as other phenotype and clinical data.

We host serveral versions of the TCGA data:
- [TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN))
- [TCGA data from GDC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https%3A%2F%2Fgdc.xenahubs.net)
- [TCGA data that has been co-analyzed with GTEx normal samples and can be used to compare tumor vs normal expression from the same tissue of origin](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20TARGET%20GTEx)
- [Legacy TCGA data (pre Pan-Cancer Atlas)](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://tcga.xenahubs.net:443)

##More studies
- [ICGC](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?hub=https://icgc.xenahubs.net:443): includes TCGA data (U.S.A.) plus data contributed by groups from other countries in the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The resource has non-coding somatic mutation data from non-TCGA samples.
- [MET500](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=MET500%20(expression%20centric)): gene expression data from the metastatic cancer cohort published by [Robinson et al 2017 Integrative clinical genomics of metastatic cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783718)
- [CCLE](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=Cancer%20Cell%20Line%20Encyclopedia%20(CCLE)): Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel (~1100) of human cancer cell lines.
