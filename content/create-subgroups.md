| With Xena you can compare expression of a gene between wild type and mutant samples, or between samples with copy number amplifications and deletions, or between any other subgroups.

GDC TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma
EGFR
Copy number
Mutation
Gene expression

We found that samples that have aberrations in EGFR (mutations or amplifications) have higher expression
