| Xena compiles easy-to-use data files derived from public resources like TCGA or GDC. These tab-delimited files, such as Pan-cancer gene expression data matrix, can be easily imported into R or python.

We download genomics source data from public repositories. The downloaded data are compiled and wrangled into a generic tabular or matrix format files.  For example, we download more than a thousand individual TCGA Breast cancer gene expression data files, compile them into a single tab-delimited file of gene expression data matrix. These data files are loaded to public Xena Data Hubs. Xena Browser provides data visualization of these data. These easy-to-use pre-compiled data files are also available for download from Xene Browser. They can be easily imported into R, python, or a Jupyter notebook to be used in further bioinformatics analysis. Save your time to download and compile these data from source.
